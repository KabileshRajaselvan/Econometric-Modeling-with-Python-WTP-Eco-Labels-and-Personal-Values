3️⃣ Open the Notebook:

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Open 21MIA1132_Econometrics_ipynb.ipynb

Run the cells sequentially

🔍 Implementation Overview
Data Loading:
Load consumer survey data from an external CSV or spreadsheet source

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Summary statistics, missing value checks, and variable transformations

Model Building:

Perform Multiple Linear Regression using statsmodels

Evaluate model coefficients and statistical significance

Assumption Testing:

Check for normality of residuals

Homoscedasticity (constant variance)

Multicollinearity via correlation matrices

Result Interpretation:
Analyze regression output, identify significant predictors, and visualize relationships

🧪 Output
Cleaned and prepared dataset

Regression model summary with coefficient estimates and p-values

Visualizations: scatter plots, histograms, residual plots, correlation heatmaps

Statistical insights for decision making

💡 Applications
Validate hypotheses in marketing and consumer behavior studies

Measure the impact of eco-labeling and environmental attitudes on purchasing decisions

Guide data-driven business strategies for sustainable products

📝 Notes
Ensure the required Python libraries are installed before running the notebook

Data file paths or URLs might need adjustment if using a different dataset

For larger datasets, execution time might increase for regression diagnostics
